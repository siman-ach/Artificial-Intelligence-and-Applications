    "**A set of states**: The puzzle has a number of different states which depend on the integer locations of the titles.\n",

    "The A* Algorithm is a searching algorithm that works to achieve the lowest cost path between two (initial and final) nodes. It uses a heuristic function wherein it decides which path to follow next based on choosing the node which has the lower weight. In this way it is able to give an estimate of the minimum cost between the initial and the target node.  \n",

    "The algorithm consists of 3 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $f(n)$ : refers to the weight of the nodes, i.e the total estimated cost of path via node $n$. It is the sum of two numbers ('g' and 'h').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* $g(n)$ : refers to the cost so far to reach the current node $n$ (from the initial node/ root state). It ensures that all the higher nodes are traversed. For e.g. the 8-puzzle begins with two possible moves which can be made. This 'g’ number makes sure to traverse both of these moves rather than choosing one and attemping to complete the rest of the puzzle from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* $h(n)$ : the estimated cost from $n$ to the target node. It refers to the heuristic part of the cost function, i.e. it is a guess of how close the current node is to the final target node. There are various ways in which to calculate $h$, therefore a good heuristic can affect the performance of an A* search considerably. In other words, it will result in an optimal search if the heuristic is admissible. \n",

    "The two admissible heuristic functions I have chosen are the Manhattan and Euclidean. They are admissible because the cost which they express is always going to be smaller than the real cost to the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Admissible heuristics do not overestimate the number of moves to solve a problem. In this puzzle, you are only able to move the block one at a time, and in 4 directions such that in each move it is closer to the final configuration by one position. Once the minimum weighting has been achived (0), the puzzle is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan distance is the sum of the distances of each tile to their goal state. Therefore the heuristic value will get smaller if the tiles are closer to their goal position. In an optimal scenario, each block has a clear path to its goal state, and this is known as an M.D. (Manhattan Distance) of 1. The rest of the states would require a greater number moves than the M.D. to reach the goal state, so would be sub-optimal. Therefore the Manhattan Distance does not overestimate and is admissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Manhattan distance, we sum the horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) to the target, whereas for Eucledian we take the direct (straight-line) distance. The Eucledian distance is found by summing the Eucledian distances of each title from its goal position. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is my theory that that since the Manhattan distance gives a more realistic representation of how the titles in the puzzle move it may give a better heuristic, and that is why I have chosen these two functions to see which performs better and which takes less time."
